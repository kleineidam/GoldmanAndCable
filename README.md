# Student Course: The Goldman equation and the cable model

This course is presented as a Jupyter notebook (![Course.ipynb](https://github.com/moritz-s/GoldmanAndCable/blob/main/Course.ipynb)).

- Start an interactive Notebook here:
  [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/moritz-s/GoldmannAndCable/HEAD?labpath=Course.ipynb)
  This online service is not very fast but works fine. (In some cases the
		  service needs to rebuild the environment which may take some minutes. When the
		  link is used again at a later time it loads faster.)

- If you know how to install python packages, you can also download the file and run the course on your computer.
  (e.g. use [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) and install the packages from the 
  [environment.yml](https://github.com/moritz-s/GoldmanAndCable/blob/main/environment.yml) file.)
